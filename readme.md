# BigStack

**BigStack** is more than just code—it's a mindset. This npm package embodies the BigStack philosophy: a full-stack approach that merges hardware, software, and IoT to build comprehensive, scalable solutions.

With BigStack, we aim to remind developers that successful digital services go beyond front-end and back-end development. BigStack is about integrating the entire ecosystem—IoT, cloud services, human-centered design, and leadership.

## Key Features

- **Welcome Message**: A greeting to introduce you to the BigStack mindset.
- **Random Stack Advice**: Get inspired with random advice for full-stack IoT and hardware development.
- **Mock Sensor Data**: Simulate IoT sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity) to bring a bit of the hardware world into your code.
- **Device Status Generator**: Check the status of a mock IoT device, promoting the importance of connectivity in full-stack development.

## Installation

Install BigStack via npm:

```bash
npm install bigstack
